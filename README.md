Seed phenotyping using mobile instruments and visual measurement for Smartphones 

It is crucial to increase the phenotyping throughput for quantitatively assessing the fruitÂ attributes for crop breeding and variety screening. This study describes a portable, low-cost smartphone-based tool that can perform high-throughput field phenotyping of crops. The main platform for the instrument is a smartphone, which provides a wealth of capability for quickly prototyping the crop. First step is, machine vision, which uses image processing to measure morphological parameters, is made possible by enhanced computational power and high-resolution cameras. Second, the Bluetooth module makes connectivity for device control convenient. Thirdly, an easy-to-use Human-Machine Interface (HMI) makes it simple for users to identify and fix computation errors. This study will show that a smartphone might potentially take the role of an industrial camera and computer as a low-cost crop phenotyping tool.
